1. Write Test Scenarios You Would Perform Manually

Test Scenarios 01:Standard Successful Order
Test Case 01: 
Verify that a valid, authenticated user can successfully place an order with correct product details and a valid coupon.

Precondition: 
Valid auth token is included in the request header. Product exists and is in stock.

Request Body: 
{ "productId": 101, "quantity": 2, "coupon": "DISCOUNT10" }

Expected Result:
200 OK with a valid orderId (555) and the correct total (900).

Test Scenarios 02:Order Without Coupon
Test Case 01: 
Verify that an order can be placed successfully even when the optional coupon field is not provided.

Precondition: 
Valid auth token and Product is available.

Request Body: 
{ "productId": 101, "quantity": 2 }

Expected Result:
200 OK with a valid orderId and a total calculated without any discount.

Test Scenarios 03: Unauthorized Access
Test Case 01: 
Verify that the API blocks order creation when no valid authentication token is provided.

Precondition: 
Remove or invalidate the Authorization token in the request header.
Request Body: 
{ "productId": 101, "quantity": 2, "coupon": "DISCOUNT10" }

Expected Result:
401 Unauthorized with response body: { "error": "Login required" }. This directly tests the documented 401 response.

2. Describe One Negative Test Case That is Not Obvious
Non-Obvious Negative Test Case: Product Stock Race Condition
1.Test Case: An authenticated user attempts to place an order for a product where the available stock is exactly equal to the requested quantity. Immediately before the order is finalized.
2.Expected Result: Only one of the two requests should succeed with a 200 OK. The other request must fail with a 400 Bad Request.


3. How Would You Verify the Coupon Calculation is Correct?

1.Pre-Calculation: Determine the expected final total price before sending the API request.

Retrieve Base Data: Get the base price of productId: 101 ($500).
Calculate Subtotal: Multiply the base price by the requested quantity: $500 * 2 = $1000.
Apply Coupon Logic: Independently apply the rules for DISCOUNT 10%: $1000 * 0.10 = $100 discount.
Calculate Expected Total: $1000 - $100 = $900.

2.API Execution: Send the request: { "productId": 101, "quantity": 2, "coupon": "DISCOUNT10" }.

3.Post-Execution Verification:
Verify the HTTP status code is 200 OK.
Compare the returned total value (900) against the pre-calculated expected value ($900).

4. How Would You Report a Bug if the Total Price Calculation is Wrong?

Title: Incorrect total price when applying DISCOUNT10 coupon
Description: The API applies the wrong discount percentage. Instead of 10%, only 5% is applied.
Steps to Reproduce:
1.Use productId 101 (price $500).
2.Apply coupon DISCOUNT10.
3.Send POST request:{ "productId": 101, "quantity": 2, "coupon": "DISCOUNT10" }
4.Check the total value in the response.
Expected Result: Total should be $900 after applying 10% discount.
Actual Result: API returns $950.
Severity/Priority: High / critical
