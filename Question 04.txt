Question 4: Dynamic Chart Loading Issue

1. How would you investigate the issue?
1.Replication and Scope Definition: Attempt to reproduce the issue across different browsers and devices if it's client-specific. Check the bug tracking system for similar, previously reported issues.
2.Log Analysis: Examine server-side logs for the time window when the user reported the freeze. 
3.Real-Time Monitoring: Use browser developer tools to monitor the network activity.

2. Which tools or techniques would you use to debug?
1. API Testing Tools: Postman
2. Developer Tools: Network Tab,Performance Tab
3. Stress/Load Testing Tools: JMeter or LoadRunner

3. Suggest 3 potential root causes for this problem.
1.Inefficient Data Retrieval: The API endpoint providing data to the charts executes a slow. This causes the API request to time out.
2.Client-Side Rendering Overload: The chart library is attempting to render an excessively large number of data points directly in the browser DOM.
3.Infinite Loop in Chart Logic: A bug in the chart's JavaScript code it causes the browser's memory usage to spike rapidly and leading to a crash.

4. Write one clear bug report example for this issue.
