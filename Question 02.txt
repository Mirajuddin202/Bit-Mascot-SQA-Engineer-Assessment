1. What type of bug is this?
This is a Data Persistence and Session Management bug.It indicates that the shopping cart data is being stored as a client-side session variable.

2. How would you reproduce it step by step?
Step:01
Title: Log in a valid user account.
Expected Result: User is authenticated.
Actual Result: User is authenticated.

Step:02
Title: Navigate to a product page.
Expected Result: Cart updates to the added items.
Actual Result: Cart is updates.

Step:03
Title: Verify on the cart page.
Expected Result: Items are present.
Actual Result: Items are present.


Step:04
Title: Click the "Log Out" button.
Expected Result: User session is terminated.
Actual Result: User session is terminated, cart data is not saved to the database.

Step:05
Title: Using the same user account.
Expected Result: The system saved cart data from the database.
Actual Result: The system an empty cart.

Step:06
Title: Navigate to the cart page.
Expected Result: items are still in the cart.
Actual Result: The cart is empty.

3. Suggest one solution or workaround the development team could implement.
Solution: Implement Server-Side Cart Merging Logic

1.Cart Storage: When a user is logged out, store the cart data in a database record.

2.Login Event Trigger: Upon a successful login, the system must execute a cart merging function:
Check if a cart exists.
Check if the user already has a persistent cart associated with their User ID.
Clear: Delete the anonymous cart data.

4. What additional tests would you perform to prevent similar issues elsewhere?
1.Data Integrity Tests: Verify that changes to a user's profile persist correctly after logging out and logging back in.

2.Session Timeout Tests: Leave the application idle until the session times out. When the user is prompted to log in again and verify that any unsaved data is either preserved.
